# Main file
There is one LaTeX file `main.tex` from which the final pdf report is compiled.

## Macros 
To ease typestting for others, I separated any packages and report-specific settings from the main file.

All packages and custom commands have been included in the `macros.sty` file within the same directory.

Contributors are advised to edit the `macros.sty` file if additonal packages must be imported.

# The compiled pdf file
At any time you can acces the pdf file directly from github by opening the `main.pdf` file.
